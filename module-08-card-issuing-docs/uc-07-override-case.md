# Module 8 · Card Issuing — UC 07 · Override Case

> AI implementation brief, generated from the v5 spec (`spec/.../use-cases/`). Source of truth is the spec; regenerate, don't hand-edit.

## Context

- Module: 8 · Card Issuing · category Integration · domain `card` · command `issue-card` · outcomes: ISSUED, FAILED
- Use case: 07 · Override Case · track B · prerequisite: after 02 is wired · build shape: DB-write→API→FE · primary screen: Override modal
- Data effect: two writes + one callback
- Platform rules (non-negotiable): the orchestrator is the only caller; the whole application arrives in the envelope (plus the v5 `outputs` block, Option A); steps are independent and re-orderable; the payload is NEVER stored — only `applicationId`; every module ships `GET /cases/{id}/applicant` proxying the orchestrator; big lists are empty by default and capped at 10 rows (≤10 hydration calls); ALL APIs are idempotent — same request twice, same result once; every endpoint appears in the service's OpenAPI 3.0 (Swagger) spec.

## Story

As a bank employee I want to override a card case's outcome with a reason, when the automatic decision is wrong — without touching the bureau and without any card data appearing that was never stored.

## Contract

```
POST /cases/{id}/override
{"newOutcome":"FAILED",
 "reason":"bureau confirmed instruction
   lost — reissue via queue",
 "operator":"b.dimovski"}
→ 200 + updated case
```

## Acceptance criteria

1. POST /cases/{id}/override {newOutcome, reason, operator} → 200; the case's outcome updates immediately.
2. reason and operator are mandatory → 400 without either; newOutcome must be ISSUED or FAILED.
3. An override_log row is written: applicationId, old outcome, new outcome, reason, operator, timestamp.
4. The module POSTs a fresh callback with status local-manual and the new outcome — a journey parked on the FAILED case resumes.
5. Overriding a case with no card data (never issued) to ISSUED → 409 with a message pointing at the queue: an ISSUED record without a PAN would be a lie; the retry path is how cards come to exist.
6. Overriding Maria's ISSUED case to FAILED (lost instruction, per the bureau's phone call) shows the new outcome on the board and the override in the history — her card data (last4/hash) remains, marked superseded.  ⟵ **checkpoint — exact value**
7. The status history stays untouched — the record shows what the machine observed AND what the human decided; the bureau is never called on this path.

## Expected data changes

- **UPDATE card_record** SET outcome — the only operator-editable field.
- **INSERT override_log** (old, new, reason, operator, at).
- Callback status local-manual tells the orchestrator a human decided — the journey resumes.
- card_status_history rows untouched: observed history preserved forever.

### Entity model (suggested — the shape to beat)

![Entity model](diagrams/er-suggested.jpg)

**CardRecord — one card per applicationId (unique), masked from birth; no column can hold a full PAN**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| applicationId | string | PK | the journey key from the envelope — unique, the ONLY applicant-related column, AND the bureau instruction's reference |
| outcome | enum |  | ISSUED or FAILED — both FAILED reasons (bad address, bureau down) are fixable by a person, never a refusal |
| reference | string |  | human-facing case reference shown on screens and in the callback, e.g. crd-000064 — becomes outputs.cardId |
| panLast4 | char(4) |  | the last four digits, e.g. 4242 — the human-readable half of the masked pair; the column physically cannot hold more |
| panHash | char(64) |  | salted SHA-256 of the full PAN — answers "is this the same card?" for machines; NEVER the PAN itself |
| bureauCardId | string, nullable |  | the bureau's own id for the card, e.g. bur-77103; null on FAILED |
| bureauStatus | enum |  | the factory's lifecycle as last observed by polling: REQUESTED, PERSONALISED or DISPATCHED — moved by the bureau, never by command |
| dispatchRef | string, nullable |  | the postal tracking reference, e.g. RM-2214-9915 — null until the bureau reports DISPATCHED |
| accountId | string, nullable |  | module 7's account from outputs, e.g. acc-000123 — the account this card spends against; anchored-and-flagged if absent (re-ordered saga) |
| productCode | string |  | the product issued, e.g. CREDIT_CARD_REWARDS — drives card artwork/tier in the candidate design rule |
| manualAddress | boolean |  | true when an operator typed a corrected delivery address in the queue — the address itself is never persisted, only this trace |
| issuingConfigVersion | int | FK | the IssuingConfig version whose PAN range and delivery rules issued this card — pinned forever |
| issuedAt | timestamp, nullable |  | when the card was issued (PAN generated, bureau instructed); null on FAILED |

**IssuingConfig — insert-only, versioned PAN range and delivery rules; current = MAX(version)**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| version | int | PK | one new row per change — rows are inserted, never updated; current = MAX(version) |
| panPrefix | string |  | the reserved TEST range every PAN starts with (seeded 999900) — no real network owns it, so no generated number can collide with a live card |
| panLength | int |  | total PAN length including the Luhn check digit (seeded 16) |
| deliveryCountries | JSON |  | countries the bureau will post to (seeded [GB, IE]) — rule 2 rejects addresses outside them |
| requiredAddressFields | JSON |  | the fields an alternative delivery address must have (seeded [line1, city, postcode, country]) |
| bureauBaseUrl | string |  | where the mock bureau lives — the base URL for instructions and status polls |
| effectiveFrom | timestamp |  | when this version became the current one |

**CardStatusHistory — the observed bureau lifecycle; one append-only row per transition, written by the poller**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| applicationId | string | FK | the card whose observed transition this row records |
| status | enum |  | the bureau status observed: REQUESTED, PERSONALISED or DISPATCHED — the timeline screen reads straight off this |
| source | enum |  | how the observation happened: ISSUE (the initial instruction) or POLL (the scheduled status check) |
| observedAt | timestamp |  | when THIS module saw the transition — the bureau moves on its own clock; we find out by asking |

**OverrideLog — audit trail; one row per manual override, none ever deleted**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| applicationId | string | FK | the card case that was overridden |
| oldOutcome | enum |  | the outcome before the override |
| newOutcome | enum |  | the outcome after — a human-known fact asserted without touching the bureau |
| reason | string |  | the mandatory justification typed by the operator |
| operator | string |  | who performed the override |
| overriddenAt | timestamp |  | when it happened |

Relationships: CardRecord 1:N CardStatusHistory — every observed bureau transition writes one row · CardRecord N:1 IssuingConfig — each card pins the config version that issued it · CardRecord 1:N OverrideLog — every restricted override is audited against its case

## Out of scope

Calling the bureau (override is a record correction — the queue's retry is the path that issues); minting card data (an override to ISSUED cannot invent a PAN — see AC 5); editing any other field.

## Build notes

The ONE permitted operator mutation of a CardRecord's outcome. Distinct from UC 04's retry on purpose: retry re-runs the flow (fresh PAN, real instruction), override asserts a fact established out of band. Writes the shared override_log and re-notifies the orchestrator with callback status local-manual.

## Tests

Slice test: happy path, missing reason → 400, unknown id → 404, ISSUED-without-card-data → 409; service test asserts the callback fires once and NO bureau client call is made.

## Definition of done

All acceptance criteria verified against the running app · `./mvnw test` green · teammate-reviewed PR merged to main · fresh clone builds green · endpoint idempotent + present in the OpenAPI 3.0 (Swagger) spec · demoable from the UI.
