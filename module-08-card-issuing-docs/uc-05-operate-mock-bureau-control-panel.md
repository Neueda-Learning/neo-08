# Module 8 · Card Issuing — UC 05 · Operate Mock Bureau Control Panel

> AI implementation brief, generated from the v5 spec (`spec/.../use-cases/`). Source of truth is the spec; regenerate, don't hand-edit.

## Context

- Module: 8 · Card Issuing · category Integration · domain `card` · command `issue-card` · outcomes: ISSUED, FAILED
- Use case: 05 · Operate Mock Bureau Control Panel · track C · prerequisite: mock bureau exists (same track) · build shape: mock API+FE · primary screen: Bureau Control Panel
- Data effect: mock dials only — no case data
- Platform rules (non-negotiable): the orchestrator is the only caller; the whole application arrives in the envelope (plus the v5 `outputs` block, Option A); steps are independent and re-orderable; the payload is NEVER stored — only `applicationId`; every module ships `GET /cases/{id}/applicant` proxying the orchestrator; big lists are empty by default and capped at 10 rows (≤10 hydration calls); ALL APIs are idempotent — same request twice, same result once; every endpoint appears in the service's OpenAPI 3.0 (Swagger) spec.

## Story

As the module team I want to control our mock bureau's clock and availability — so a card can go REQUESTED→DISPATCHED inside a demo, and the outage story can be told live.

## Contract

```
GET /bureau/admin/dials →
{"secondsPerStage":120,
 "latencyMs":0,"killSwitch":false}

PUT /bureau/admin/dials
{"secondsPerStage":5} → 200
// 5s: a card dispatches inside
// fifteen seconds — demo speed
```

## Acceptance criteria

1. The mock bureau runs as its own service with its own REST API; the module reaches it only over HTTP at IssuingConfig.bureauBaseUrl.
2. A card accepted by POST /bureau/cards moves REQUESTED → PERSONALISED → DISPATCHED on the bureau's own clock, one hop per secondsPerStage, without any call from the module.  ⟵ **checkpoint — exact value**
3. GET /bureau/cards/{id} returns the current status, and — once DISPATCHED — a dispatch reference (RM-…).
4. The panel reads and writes all three dials live: secondsPerStage, latencyMs, killSwitch; current state is always visible.
5. killSwitch on → POST /bureau/cards fails → the module goes FAILED / CRD_BUREAU_UNAVAILABLE and the case enters the queue — demoable end to end.
6. With secondsPerStage=5, Maria's card reaches DISPATCHED within 15 seconds of issue — the timeline demo's clock.  ⟵ **checkpoint — exact value**
7. Dials reset to defaults (120s, 0ms, off) on mock restart — a fresh compose up always starts healthy.

## Expected data changes

- **No module case data changes from the panel** — dials are the mock's in-memory state.
- The lifecycle side effects live in the MOCK's store: statuses advancing, a dispatchRef minted — invisible to the module until it polls.
- That gap — the factory knows before the bank does — is exactly what UC 06's poller closes.

### Entity model (suggested — the shape to beat)

![Entity model](diagrams/er-suggested.jpg)

**CardRecord — one card per applicationId (unique), masked from birth; no column can hold a full PAN**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| applicationId | string | PK | the journey key from the envelope — unique, the ONLY applicant-related column, AND the bureau instruction's reference |
| outcome | enum |  | ISSUED or FAILED — both FAILED reasons (bad address, bureau down) are fixable by a person, never a refusal |
| reference | string |  | human-facing case reference shown on screens and in the callback, e.g. crd-000064 — becomes outputs.cardId |
| panLast4 | char(4) |  | the last four digits, e.g. 4242 — the human-readable half of the masked pair; the column physically cannot hold more |
| panHash | char(64) |  | salted SHA-256 of the full PAN — answers "is this the same card?" for machines; NEVER the PAN itself |
| bureauCardId | string, nullable |  | the bureau's own id for the card, e.g. bur-77103; null on FAILED |
| bureauStatus | enum |  | the factory's lifecycle as last observed by polling: REQUESTED, PERSONALISED or DISPATCHED — moved by the bureau, never by command |
| dispatchRef | string, nullable |  | the postal tracking reference, e.g. RM-2214-9915 — null until the bureau reports DISPATCHED |
| accountId | string, nullable |  | module 7's account from outputs, e.g. acc-000123 — the account this card spends against; anchored-and-flagged if absent (re-ordered saga) |
| productCode | string |  | the product issued, e.g. CREDIT_CARD_REWARDS — drives card artwork/tier in the candidate design rule |
| manualAddress | boolean |  | true when an operator typed a corrected delivery address in the queue — the address itself is never persisted, only this trace |
| issuingConfigVersion | int | FK | the IssuingConfig version whose PAN range and delivery rules issued this card — pinned forever |
| issuedAt | timestamp, nullable |  | when the card was issued (PAN generated, bureau instructed); null on FAILED |

**IssuingConfig — insert-only, versioned PAN range and delivery rules; current = MAX(version)**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| version | int | PK | one new row per change — rows are inserted, never updated; current = MAX(version) |
| panPrefix | string |  | the reserved TEST range every PAN starts with (seeded 999900) — no real network owns it, so no generated number can collide with a live card |
| panLength | int |  | total PAN length including the Luhn check digit (seeded 16) |
| deliveryCountries | JSON |  | countries the bureau will post to (seeded [GB, IE]) — rule 2 rejects addresses outside them |
| requiredAddressFields | JSON |  | the fields an alternative delivery address must have (seeded [line1, city, postcode, country]) |
| bureauBaseUrl | string |  | where the mock bureau lives — the base URL for instructions and status polls |
| effectiveFrom | timestamp |  | when this version became the current one |

**CardStatusHistory — the observed bureau lifecycle; one append-only row per transition, written by the poller**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| applicationId | string | FK | the card whose observed transition this row records |
| status | enum |  | the bureau status observed: REQUESTED, PERSONALISED or DISPATCHED — the timeline screen reads straight off this |
| source | enum |  | how the observation happened: ISSUE (the initial instruction) or POLL (the scheduled status check) |
| observedAt | timestamp |  | when THIS module saw the transition — the bureau moves on its own clock; we find out by asking |

**OverrideLog — audit trail; one row per manual override, none ever deleted**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| applicationId | string | FK | the card case that was overridden |
| oldOutcome | enum |  | the outcome before the override |
| newOutcome | enum |  | the outcome after — a human-known fact asserted without touching the bureau |
| reason | string |  | the mandatory justification typed by the operator |
| operator | string |  | who performed the override |
| overriddenAt | timestamp |  | when it happened |

Relationships: CardRecord 1:N CardStatusHistory — every observed bureau transition writes one row · CardRecord N:1 IssuingConfig — each card pins the config version that issued it · CardRecord 1:N OverrideLog — every restricted override is audited against its case

## Out of scope

A bureau that calls the module back (real bureaus don't — finding out by asking is the design); persisting dial history (dials are live state, not config — versioned policy is UC 08).

## Build notes

The mock is its own REST API (own package or container): POST /bureau/cards (accept instruction → card id + REQUESTED) and GET /bureau/cards/{id} (current status). It moves each card REQUESTED→PERSONALISED→DISPATCHED on its own clock — secondsPerStage per hop — and mints a dispatchRef at the final hop. The module only ever learns by polling (UC 06). The bureau stores the instruction's delivery address — it is the factory; that is where the address lives.

## Tests

Mock's own tests: lifecycle advances per fake clock, dispatchRef minted at DISPATCHED, kill switch → connection refused/503, latency honoured; module-side test with kill switch on → CRD_BUREAU_UNAVAILABLE path.

## Definition of done

All acceptance criteria verified against the running app · `./mvnw test` green · teammate-reviewed PR merged to main · fresh clone builds green · endpoint idempotent + present in the OpenAPI 3.0 (Swagger) spec · demoable from the UI.
